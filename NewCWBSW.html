<strong>DPW's New Stormwater Advisory Committee Selects Leaders -</strong>

In November of 2014, the Baltimore City Department of Public Works (DPW) created the Stormwater Advisory Committee (SWAC).  The purpose of SWAC is to advise the Department on stormwater projects, programs, and issues, and to help educate stakeholder groups on related matters. To date the Advisory Committee has reviewed and provided comment on:
<ul>
	<li>The City's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Watershed Implementation Plan, which guides DPW's capital improvement projects for stormwater management and stream restoration;</li>
	<li>Stormwater fee regulations for port industries;</li>
	<li>Proposed changes to the State's stormwater fee legislation;</li>
	<li>DPW's stormwater utility fund and how stormwater fees are used to improve water quality; and</li>
	<li>The Clean Water Baltimore website and associated educational material.</li>
</ul>
In creating the Stormwater Advisory Committee, DPW Director Rudolph S. Chow, P.E., announced, “I am confident that the Stormwater Advisory Committee members have selected leaders who will help the committee work to create an examination process that is fiscally transparent, has the support of the wider community, and benefits a range of groups throughout the City.”

The SWAC is made up of volunteer members representing a diversity of sectors, including environmental non-profits, businesses and industries, anchor institutions and citizens. The members are:
<ul>
	<li>Jennifer Aiosa, Friends of Patterson Park / Blue Water Baltimore</li>
	<li>Kimberly Brandt, 1000 Friends of Maryland</li>
	<li>Bif Browning, Southwest Partnership</li>
	<li>Debbie Cameron, Baltimore Tree Trust</li>
	<li>Terry Cummings, Chesapeake Bay Foundation [Chair]</li>
	<li>Brian Hammock, CSX / South Baltimore Business Alliance</li>
	<li>Matthew Kimball, Building Owners and Managers Association of Baltimore</li>
	<li>Ashley Pennington, Johns Hopkins University Office of Sustainability</li>
	<li>Joan Plisko, Maryland Hospitals for a Healthy Environment</li>
	<li>Alan Pressman, BGE</li>
	<li>Daryl Sabourin, ASR Inc., Domino Sugar / Baltimore Port Alliance [Vice-Chair]</li>
	<li>Noah Smock, Baltimore Community ToolBank</li>
	<li>Bonnie Sorak, Interfaith Partners for the Chesapeake</li>
</ul>
Staff from DPW and other City agencies, such as the departments of Transportation, Recreation and Parks, and the Public Schools, serve as ex-officio members to support the committee.

SWAC meets on a quarterly basis, with sub-committees meeting in between. Advisory Committee meetings are open to the public and are advertised in advance.
